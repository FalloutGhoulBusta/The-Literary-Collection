The Literary Collection Library
A responsive online library application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases modern frontend development techniques without relying on external frameworks, making it an excellent learning resource for web development fundamentals.

🚀 Features
Core Functionality
Interactive Book Grid: Displays a responsive grid of books with cover images, titles, and authors- Category Filtering: Filter books by categories (Fiction, Non-Fiction, Science, Fantasy)- Book Details: Click any book to view detailed information in another page- Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout that works on all device sizes
User Experience
Visual Feedback: Interactive elements provide clear visual feedback- Accessible: Built with accessibility in mind, including proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation- Performance: Optimized for fast loading and smooth interactions
Performance Optimizations
Lazy Loading: Images are loaded only when they're about to enter the viewport, improving initial page load time- Efficient Rendering: The book grid is rendered efficiently using modern JavaScript- Minimal Dependencies: No external libraries or frameworks, reducing bundle size

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
No server required - runs directly in the browser
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone [repository-url]
Navigate to the project directory
Open index.html in your preferred web browser
🎨 Customization
Adding New Books
Open script.js2. Add a new book object to the books array with the following structure:
{
    id: [unique-number],
    title: "Book Title",
    author: "Author Name",
    category: "category-name",
    cover: "images/book-cover.jpg",
    description: "Detailed book description...",
    published: "Year",
    pages: [page-count],
    language: "Language",
    shortDescription: "Brief description for hover effect"
}
Add the corresponding book cover image to the images/ directory
Styling
Main styles are in styles.css- Color scheme and design tokens are defined at the top of the file
The layout uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design
Adding New Categories
Add a new filter button in index.html:
<button class="filter-btn" data-category="new-category">New Category</button>
The filtering logic in script.js will automatically handle the new category
🧠 Technical Implementation
Key JavaScript Functions
displayBooks(booksToDisplay): Renders books to the DOM- handleSearch(): Implements real-time search functionality- filterByCategory(category): Handles category filtering- setupEventListeners(): Manages all event listeners
State Management
filteredBooks: Tracks currently displayed books- currentCategory: Tracks active category filter
📱 Responsive Design
